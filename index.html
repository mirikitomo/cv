  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>When I was in elementary school I belonged to a computer club where I used Macintosh and saw for the first time the innovative technology of barcode readers with a laser. I also had the opportunity to use the Windows 95 operating system in my
    school library and my first personal computer was equipped with Windows 98.</p>
  <p>I always wanted my dream job to be one related to computers, but the technology continues to advance and nowadays we have tablets and smartphones replacing the traditional computer. I remain focused on that dream and now finally I'm part of a
    team here in DXC Technology where my dream come true, having the opportunity to troubleshoot and help everyone no matter if it’s a computer, tablet or smartphone. I always try to be up-to-date, so I am constantly looking for ways to educate
    myself to keep up with modern technology. I passed the test exam and now I am a ServiceNow Certified System Administrator. My next step will be to become a ServiceNow Application Developer and this website is being build as part of the Complete
    2019 Web
    Development Boot Camp from Udemy.</P>
  <p>Before DXC I was a Sales Representative at an AT&T Authorized Retailer store. There, I was focused on using my knowledge and passion to deliver an effortless customer experience. My primary objective was the sales of all new smartphones,
    altogether with a variety of awesome products like TV service provider, wearable, and tablets to connect our customers to their world. I was able to build integrated solutions for our valued customers to meet and exceed their needs and my key
    sales objectives. </p>
